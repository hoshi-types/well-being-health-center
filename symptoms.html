<p class="sym-paragraph">Headaches and migraines are common conditions but not normal.  <em>Dr. Michelle Gip DC</em> and <em>Dr. Luan Gip DC</em> have helped thousands of patients suffering from tension headaches and migraine headaches.  Whether the pain is sharp, dull, behind the eyes, or all over, headaches and migraines may last a couple hours or even a couple days, depending on the severity. Headaches and migraines can occur for several reasons including dehydration, head injury, neck injury, upper back injury, tension, side effects from medication, and even lack of slee. The most common similarity between all headaches and migraines, however, is the tension in muscles.</p>

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="autoaccidentinjury">Treatment For Auto Accident Injury</h1>
<p class="sym-paragraph">Dr. Michelle Gip DC and Dr. Luan Gip DC have helped thousands of patients suffering from auto accident injuries. An auto accident injury can cause serious injuries and should be taken seriously. Depending on the angle in which the car was hit, several injuries may arise after the auto accident. However, not all symptoms will show up immediately, and you may not be aware of the severity of your injury until the inflammation has decreased. On occasion, someone involved in an auto accident may not reach out for treatment because they don't feel symptoms immediately. Sometimes, the pain comes on later. 
    <br><br>
    One of the most common auto accident injuries happens to the neck. This auto accident injury is called whiplash, which typically occurs when a car is rear-ended. When a person's head is suddenly forced to move in any direction, it can cause severe damage to the neck muscles, ligaments, and connective tissues. and cause spinal subluxations. Dr. Michelle Gip DC and Dr. Luan Gip DC can identify subluxations in the upper back and neck and help soft tissue of the spine so the nerves can communicate freely with the rest of the body. Back pain and neck pain are two common reasons for people for visit a chiropractor.

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="neckpain">Treatment For Neck Pain</h1>
<p class="sym-paragraph">Upper back pain and neck pain can be related, whether it is from a misalignment in the upper thoracic spine or in the lower cervical spine, because many of the nerves are connected to the same areas of vertebrae and may affect the same areas of the body. Neck pain can be associated with injuries such as whiplash or an acute injury such as a kink in the neck, and it is often caused by a misalignment in the cervical spine. Upper back pain, on the other hand, can also be affected by nerves that extend from the cervical spine, but it is often associated with a misalignment in the thoracic spine (mid back) where the nerves can reach most areas of the upper body.</p>

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="pinched">Treatment For Pinched Nerve</h1>

<p class="sym-paragraph"> Pinched nerves can be described as sharp shooting pain sometimes with numbness and tingling. A pinched nerve can happen from muscle or tendon inflammation, bone issues, and subluxations in the back. With most pinched nerves, irritation in and around a joint can impinge nerves. Think of a pinched nerve like a pinched water hose. When the hose is pinched, water cannot flow freely out of the hose. When a nerve is pinched, just like the water in the hose, signals from the central nervous system to the certain body part are disrupted and cannot flow freely. Nerve signals that are disrupted can lead to several issues including unhealthy or irritated nerve fibers in the body, which lead to pain, numbness, tingling, and other symptoms.

    Chiropractic care can help spinal subluxations that improves nerve communication, and it can help your body heal naturally from other conditions that may be causing a pinched nerve. In fact, a chiropractor understands very well how nerves connect to the body from the back and how a minor subluxation can cause major problems. That's why Dr. Michelle Gip DC and Dr. Luan Gip DC offer chiropractic adjustments in a comfortable and soothing environment.</p>

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="workinjury">Treatment For Work Injury</h1>
<p class="sym-paragraph">Work injuries can be devastating experiences since a person is affected emotionally, physically, and financially as well. The most common types of work related injuries are ones that produce back pain and neck pain. Back and neck injuries account for approximately 75% of work-related injuries. The goal of chiropractic care is to help the injured worker heal through natural means rather than depending on medications, so they can return to their daily activities in the safest manner possible.

    
    Many work-related injuries are caused by regular, everyday activities on the job. Most occupations require a worker to do the same movements with their body. Repetitive motions cause trauma in the body and create tension in the body. Repetitive stress injuries (like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome) are common and typically the cause of health conditions.
    

    Chiropractic care is a beneficial treatment that can help reduce pain from work-related injuries. Dr. Michelle Gip DC and Dr. Luan Gip DC offer various chiropractic techniques to help our patients find pain relief. </p>

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="shoulderpain">Treatment For Shoulder Pain</h1>
<p class="sym-paragraph">Shoulder pain can occur for several reasons including tendonitis, bursitis, injury, instability, and arthritis. Pain may also arise as a result of frozen shoulder or issues with the rotator cuff. Pretty much anything from a car accident to a chronic condition can cause shoulder pain. Symptoms of shoulder injuries may produce chronic pain, acute pain, twinges or aches, and decreased function of the arm. Overuse and different types of injuries can also have a great impact on shoulder pain.
<br><br>
    Proper chiropractic care can have a tremendous impact on the level of pain a person can experience. Our goal with chiropractic care is to help people with shoulder pain find an alternative solution so they can avoid pain medications and an evasive procedure. Before a chiropractic adjustment, our doctors will examine the neck area to check for any abnormalities or subluxations in the cervical spine that could be causing shoulder pain. </p>

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="lowbackpain">Treatment For Low Back Pain</h1>
<p class="sym-paragraph">Low back pain affects approximately 80% of Americans at one point in their lives. Low back pain is considered the second most common reason people choose to visit the chiropractor's office. The lower back hosts the most used joints in our body, which are the hip joints. Not just that, but when there is a problem with muscles or nerves in the lower back, there is a tremendous amount of pain that can impact a person's everyday life. Low back pain can be the result of many different situations and activities, including Heavy lifting, awkward movements, muscle spasms, bulging discs, herniated discs, sciatica, osteoarthritis, scoliosis, osteoporosis, aging, anxiety, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, strenuous activity, pregnancy, sprained ligaments, ruptured disks, strained muscles, poor posture, stress, and obesity.

    ​<br><br>
    
    To properly treat your low back pain, Dr. Michelle Gip DC and Dr. Luan Gip DC may provide a chiropractic adjustment to your low back and pelvis to help realign any subluxation and relieve tension caused by low back pain. Chiropractic care is aimed at helping your body heals naturally, so you can avoid using muscle relaxants and pain killers to mask the symptoms rather than treat them. Chiropractic care is not only effective than most pain pills / drugs on the market, but our treatment is also much less expensive. </p>

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="tenniselbow">Treatment For Tennis Elbow</h1>
<p class="sym-paragraph">Tennis Elbow is a condition that affects the tendons and muscles around the elbow joint. This condition is similar to Golfer's Elbow, but it specifically affects the outside of the elbow; whereas, Golfer's Elbow affects the inner elbow. Tennis Elbow is closely related to tennis and other activities that involve repeated motions with the forearm and elbow. Tennis Elbow is one of many conditions that is considered a repetitive stress/strain injury since it takes repeated forceful movements of the hand, wrist, and elbow to cause this condition. People with Tennis Elbow typically experience pain in the outer part of their elbow and in the forearm tendons. Tennis Elbow will cause people to experience pain, loss of hand strength, and numbness in the hands and neck.

    ​<br><br>
    
    The common issue between Golfer's Elbow and Tennis Elbow is how it affects the nerves in the arms. Inflammation in the elbow area can cause nerve impingement or irritation and lead to more severe pain and numbness in other parts of the arm, shoulder, and neck.  can help relieve pain from tennis elbow by providing joint manipulations in the elbow and shoulder to allow the nerves to flow freely without impingement. A chiropractor will also search for misalignments in the cervical and thoracic spine to adjust those areas as well.</p>

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="CarpalTunnelSyndrome">Treatment For Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h1>
<p class="sym-paragraph">Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a condition that affects the hands, wrists, and elbows. This condition causes a narrowing of the nerve passageway in the wrist and causes an impingement of the median nerve, which originates in the spine and reaches all the way to the wrist. Any swelling in the arm, shoulder, forearm, or wrist can apply pressure on the median nerve and that can lead to pain, numbness, and limited movement. People who experience carpal tunnel are usually people who work at a desk or on a computer for eight or more hours a day. This occupational health problem affects millions of people a year. It is often a problem caused by pressure placed on the nerves when doing common daily activities. Other symptoms caused by carpal tunnel can also include weakness or loss of grip strength, tingling, burning, and wrist pain. Fortunately, alternative treatments such as chiropractic care can help with the healing of median nerve. Since the median nerve originates in the spine, a chiropractic adjustment may help in relieving the symptoms associated with carpal tunnel.

    ​<br><br>
    
    Before a chiropractic adjustment is provided, Dr. Michelle Gip DC and Dr. Luan Gip DC will exam your arm and determine whether a chiropractic adjustment will help your condition. A chiropractic adjustment may include light joint adjustments to the wrist, elbow, and cervical spine. Under normal circumstances, a chiropractor can adjust your neck or upper back to provide some relief from carpal tunnel pain symptoms.</p>

<h1 class="sym-section-head" id="Fibromyalgia">Treatment For Fibromyalgia</h1>
<p class="sym-paragraph">Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that affects the entire body. It has been reported that approximately three to six million people suffer from fibromyalgia in the United States. Fibromyalgia causes people to experience body pain, chronic fatigue, disrupted sleep patterns, irritable bowel syndrome, TMJ pain, and other psychological conditions. Symptoms of fibromyalgia may affect a person slowly, starting in their mid-adult years and worsening as they get older. Many times, patients have reported extended periods of chronic pain that accompany many other symptoms of fibromyalgia.
<br><br>
    Fortunately, chiropractic care can be considered one of best ways of treating fibromyalgia since it helps with loosening tight muscle in the body and helping the nerves communicate freely with the body. Chiropractic care can help with energy levels and restore nerve function to muscles to help decrease pain.  Dr. Michelle Gip DC and Dr. Luan Gip DC aim to restore balance in your body through chiropractic adjustments, joint manipulations, and muscle stretches to help eliminate the pain connected to fibromyalgia.</p>
